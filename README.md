# Alert-Dialogs
This is the code from my [**Alert Dialog YouTube series**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmkb5CTw5rSCT3szl8VLBjKhLC8ttt8B). It covers how to create Alert Dialogs, custom layouts for Dialogs, and ProgresDialogs. This repository contains all the code necessary to use Dialogs in your app.


**To get the code, simply go to to the [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/IJ-Apps/Alert-Dialogs/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/ij/alertdialogs/MainActivity.java) file and copy and paste it as you need.**

## Also check out the corresponding [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmkb5CTw5rSCT3szl8VLBjKhLC8ttt8B) on Alert Dialogs.
